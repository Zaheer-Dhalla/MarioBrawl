MarioBrawl

This project was completed during my junior year of high school. It works just like typeracer except, you must type out quotes in order to send attacks and heal yourself.

You may notice that there is a music panel at the top that is disabled. I did this to prevent any kinds of copyright srtrikes I might receive for playing music I do not own.
